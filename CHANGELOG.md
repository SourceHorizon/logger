## 2.0.2+1

## 2.0.2

  Mitigates [#38](https://github.com/SourceHorizon/logger/issues/38).

## 2.0.1

* Updated README to reflect v2.0.0 log signature change.

## 2.0.0

* Fixed supported platforms list.
* Removed reference to outdated `logger_flutter` project.
  Thanks to @yangsfang ([#32](https://github.com/SourceHorizon/logger/pull/32)).
* Added override capability for logger defaults.
  Thanks to @yangsfang ([#34](https://github.com/SourceHorizon/logger/pull/34)).
* `Level.verbose`, `Level.wtf` and `Level.nothing` have been deprecated and are replaced
  by `Level.trace`, `Level.fatal` and `Level.off`.
  Additionally `Level.all` has been added.
* PrettyPrinter: Added `levelColors` and `levelEmojis` as constructor parameter.

### Breaking changes

* `log` signature has been changed to closer match dart's developer `log` function and allow for
  future optional parameters.

  Additionally, `time` has been added as an optional named parameter to support providing custom
  timestamps for LogEvents instead of `DateTime.now()`.

  #### Migration:
    * Before:
      ```dart
      logger.e("An error occurred!", error, stackTrace);
      ```
    * After:
      ```dart
      logger.e("An error occurred!", error: error, stackTrace: stackTrace);
      ```
* `init` and `close` methods of `LogFilter`, `LogOutput` and `LogPrinter` are now async along
  with `Logger.close()`. (Fixes FileOutput)
* LogListeners are now called on every LogEvent independent of the filter.
* PrettyPrinter: `includeBox` is now private.
* PrettyPrinter: `errorMethodCount` is now only considered if an error has been provided.
  Otherwise `methodCount` is used.
* PrettyPrinter: Static `levelColors` and `levelEmojis` have been renamed to `defaultLevelColors`
  and `defaultLevelEmojis` and are used as fallback for their respective constructor parameters.
* Levels are now sorted by their respective value instead of the enum index (Order didn't change).

## 1.4.0

* Bumped upper SDK constraint to `<4.0.0`.
* Added `excludePaths` to PrettyPrinter. Thanks to
  @Stitch-Taotao ([#13](https://github.com/SourceHorizon/logger/pull/13)).
